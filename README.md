App to calculate the concentration of effective osmolality (a medicine student task);

Developed in Python using the packs - Pyside6 to making the design, and pyinstaler (one file) to compile the app in a single file.

The app has two inputs to calculate effective osmolality:

The measured Na+ and measure glycemic. The result is the effective osmolality.

''' About effective osmolality: Osmolality is a measure of the concentration of particles, such as ions and molecules, in a solution. Effective osmolality takes into account the concentration of only those particles that are able to move across cell membranes and influence fluid balance in the body. These particles include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, and urea.

Effective osmolality is important because it helps to determine the movement of water between different compartments of the body. For example, if the effective osmolality of the blood is higher than that of the fluid surrounding the cells, water will move out of the cells and into the blood, causing them to shrink. On the other hand, if the effective osmolality of the fluid surrounding the cells is higher than that of the blood, water will move into the cells, causing them to swell.

Effective osmolality can be calculated using the following formula:

Effective Osmolality = 2(Na+ + K+) + (Glucose/18) + (BUN/2.8)

where Na+ is the concentration of sodium in millimoles per liter (mmol/L), K+ is the concentration of potassium in mmol/L, Glucose is the concentration of glucose in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), and BUN is the concentration of blood urea nitrogen in mg/dL.

The values for Na+, K+, Glucose, and BUN can be obtained through blood tests. It is important to note that this formula assumes that all of the sodium and potassium ions are in the form of salts (e.g., NaCl and KCl). If other ions are present, such as calcium or magnesium, they should also be taken into account.


In summary, effective osmolality is a measure of the concentration of particles that affect fluid balance in the body, and it can be calculated using the concentrations of sodium, potassium, glucose, and blood urea nitrogen. Understanding effective osmolality is important for managing conditions such as dehydration, hyponatremia, and hypernatremia.
